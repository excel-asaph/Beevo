This document serves as the Master Technical Specification:

1. System Overview: The Sovereign Orchestrator
The SV-CMO is not a single chatbot; it is a Stateful Multi-Agent Dispatcher. It uses Gemini 3 Pro as a central "Brain" that coordinates specialized sub-agents.

Central Memory: The system utilizes a 1 Million Token Context Window as a "Universal Brand Vault." This vault holds all Brand DNA, historical campaigns, competitive research, and user-provided artifacts.

Modular Entry Points: The system is designed so a user can start a full campaign from scratch or jump directly into a specific "Junction" (e.g., "Just generate a Black Friday ad") without re-doing previous steps.

2. The Core Logic: Semantic Artifact Recognition
The system does not rely on specific filenames (like logo.png). Instead, it uses Native Multimodal Understanding to identify the nature of any upload.

The Scan: When a file is uploaded to a junction, the Orchestrator performs a visual and technical scan. It looks for visual characteristics of a logo (transparency, vector shapes, brand marks) or a color palette.

The Validation: Using Pixel-Precise Pointing, the AI identifies the specific coordinates of the brand mark and extracts the hex codes directly from the image.

The Confirmation: The system uses Bidi-Streaming (Voice/Text) to ask the user: "I’ve identified this as a high-resolution logo with a technical vibe. Shall I save this to your Brand Vault?"

3. Module 1: The Strategist (Intelligence & Research)
Tooling: Uses Google Antigravity (Manager View).

Execution: The system spawns an autonomous agent in a background workspace. It is tasked with crawling real-time web data (competitor sites, social trends, and news).

The "Deep Think" Factor: The agent uses Thinking Level: High to perform a SWOT analysis. It doesn't just list competitors; it reasons through their "Psychographic Hook" (why people buy from them) to find a gap for the user.

Thought Signatures: The reasoning behind the strategy is saved as a Thought Signature. This ensures that the later creative phases "remember" the strategic logic.

4. Module 2: The Architect (Identity & Soul)
Tooling: Uses Vibe Coding within AI Studio.

Execution: For users starting from scratch, the AI conducts a "Discovery Interview." As the user speaks (Voice) or types, the system autonomously codes and renders a live Style Guide in the browser.

Professional Compliance: The AI runs a reasoning loop to verify WCAG 2.1 Accessibility Standards. It ensures color contrast ratios are high enough for visually impaired users and that fonts are legible across mobile devices.

Result: A Brand DNA Artifact is generated and pinned to the 1M Token Context.

5. Module 3: The Forge (Content Creation)
Tooling: Nano Banana Pro (Image) and Veo 3.1 (Video).

Execution: * Image Precision: The system uses the "Brand DNA" as a 14-image visual reference for Nano Banana Pro. This forces the AI to use the exact logo and style in every generated ad.

Cinematic Video: The AI acts as a Cinematographer for Veo 3.1, writing precise directions for camera movement (e.g., "Slow zoom on the product to create a premium feel").

Safe Zone Logic: Using Spatial Reasoning, the agent identifies the "Dead Zones" of social media platforms (where UI buttons would cover the ad) and places all critical brand elements in the "Safe Zone" coordinates.

6. Module 4: The Guardian (Verification & Audit)
Tooling: Gemini 3 Pro Vision + Pixel-Precise Pointing.

The "Highest Degree" Audit:

Content is generated by the Forge.

The Guardian Agent compares the output against the Master Artifacts in the Vault.

If the logo is distorted by even 1%, or the text color is slightly off-brand, the AI uses Pixel-Precise Pointing to highlight the error.

Self-Correction: The AI sends the image back to the Forge with the specific error coordinates for a "Healed" version. It repeats this until the content passes a 100% brand-match audit.

7. Accessibility: The Live Trust Path
Interface: Built on the Gemini Live API.

Multimodal Switching: The user can interact via Voice while driving or Web/Touch while at a desk. The system maintains the same Thought Signature across both interfaces.

Trust Layer: For every major decision (e.g., "Why this font?"), the system offers a Reasoning Artifact. The user can ask "Why did you choose this?" and the AI explains its strategic logic based on the 1M Token Context, building user trust.

8. Final Professional Add-Ons
Multilingual Adaptation: The system can autonomously translate all assets while maintaining visual hierarchy and brand tone.

UTM & Attribution Blueprint: For every landing page generated via Vibe Coding, the AI automatically sets up tracking parameters so the business can measure real-world performance.
